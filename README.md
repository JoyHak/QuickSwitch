QuickSwitch modification by Rafaello. Based on `v0.5dw9a` by *NotNull*, *DaWolfi* and others: https://www.voidtools.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=9881

#### ABOUT

QuickSwitch allows you to switch file dialogs (like Save-As or Open) to any folder opened in supported file managers (File Explorer, Directory Opus, Total Commander, XYPlorer).

It has two modes:

1. **QuickSwitch Menu Mode**: Displays a list of opened folders. Selecting one switches the file dialog to that folder. The menu won't appear if no folders are open.

2. **AutoSwitch Mode**: After enabling this mode, the file dialog automatically opens the last active folder in the file manager when you Alt-Tab between them. If the file manager was active before opening the dialog, it opens that folder immediately. You can still use Control-Q to access the menu if needed.

There's also a "Never" option to disable QuickSwitch for specific dialogs, like web browsers, which manage their own folders.

#### INSTALLATION
This script is written in the [Autohotkey language](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/). 

1. [Download][https://www.autohotkey.com/download/] `Autohotkey v1.1...` and install it. 

> PLEASE KEEP IN MIND: Autohotkey v1 is an **outdated version.** If you want to start learning the language, install `v2`. **DO NOT LEARN AUTOHOTKEY V1 YOURSELF** and use it exclusively to run old scripts. This script needs to be updated from `AHK v1 -> v2` !

2. When the installation is complete, you are presented with another menu. Choose `Run AutoHotkey`.
Once the AutoHotkey help file opens, you can read or close it now. 

3. Download this repository (and explore it if you want). The `Libs` folder contains the components of the main `QuickSwitch.ahk` script.

4. Run `QuickSwitch.ahk` and check its existence in the tray.

5. Open different folders in a supported file manager, *for example, open `C:\` in `Explorer`.*

6. Open any application and try to open/save a file using it. *For example, open `Notepad` then `File -> Open...`*

7. Press `Ctrl+Q` (the combination can be changed in the main script) and look at the paths in the *menu* that opens. All folders opened in *supported file managers* will be displayed here. *From any similar dialog box, from any application, you can quickly navigate to these folders using this menu and save/open a file from them.*

8. Explore the available options in the menu, open the settings and experiment with them. Choose a convenient style and logic of the menu!

#### CHANGELOG

- Following the clearance of the code, the syntax has been modified to closely resemble that of Autohotkey v2, facilitating further adaptation to v2.

- The code has been restructured to enhance its clarity and to facilitate self-documentation, with additional comments added to support its interpretation.

- The code has been modified to remove Spaggification and GOTO labels, and to add structure by dividing the key elements of the script into parts and adding them to `Libs`.

- Tthe speed at which `menu with paths` from file managers appear has been **increased**.

- `AutoSwitch` has been modified to **no longer iterate over all paths** and now works directly with the latest file manager.

- `AutoSwitch exception` has been rendered obsolete.

- The drive letter can be removed from the menu.

- The ability to shorten the displayed path and cut the path from either side *(left or right)* has now been added.

###### Extended support for XYplorer:
  
- If you open a Rapid Access Folder or a virtual path (Rapid/Music, Downloads), it can be displayed instead of the full path.
- The menu will display the paths from all open folders starting from the current one. Previously, only 1 path was displayed.
